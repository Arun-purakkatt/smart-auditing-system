# Smart Auditing System [ Major Project ]

## Project Title
Develop UI for data extraction from invoices pdf using computer vision

## Abstract
n industry we receives many pdf documents of bills and invoices, which we later proceed manually so consumes time and non productive activity. In this project we are going to develop UI where user can upload invoice file (pdf or jpg) then using image processing it will automatically extract text and segregate it into different parts like Vendor name, Invoice number, item name and item quantity. We will use different image processing methods like HOG transform, Canny Edge detection, SURF & SHIFT and then proceed with tesseract python libraries. To improve text contents we can use natural language tool kits. We will develop web based UI.

## Keywords
Python, OpenCV, Tesseract, HOG, SURF and SHIFT, (for UI web based solution so HTML, CSS and javascript)
